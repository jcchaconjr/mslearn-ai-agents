"""
Preflight check for the Tailwind Traders lab.

Each task in this lab can be completed on its own. Before you start a task,
run this script to confirm your .env file has everything that task needs:

    python setup/check_env.py --task 3

It never changes anything — it only reads your .env and tells you what (if
anything) is missing, so you can fix it before running the task.

Tasks and what they need:

    Task 1  (portal)  no .env needed — you build the agent in the portal
    Task 2  (code)    PROJECT_ENDPOINT, MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME
    Task 3  (code)    PROJECT_ENDPOINT, AGENT_NAME   (the grounded portal agent)
    Task 4  (code)    PROJECT_ENDPOINT, MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME
    Task 5  (code)    PROJECT_ENDPOINT, MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME
    Task 6  (deploy)  PROJECT_ENDPOINT, MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME
